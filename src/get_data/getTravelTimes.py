# tutorial: https://blog.traveltimeplatform.com/distance-matrix-tutorial-calculate-times-to-multiple-locations

# This script downloads the travel times from all blocks listed in the "locations" array in TravelTimesDataTemplate.json in the data directory
# to all other blocks in that array. We have 65 * 65 = 4,255 blocks, hence this script produces a large CSV file with 4,255 * 4,255 = 18,105,025â€¬ rows

# How to use: Add all 4,255 blocks into TravelTimesDataTemplate.json, then run this script. The script will then make the appropriate API calls automatically.
# The travel time API allows 10,000 calls per month in the free tier and the script makes one API call to get the distances from each block to ALL OTHER blocks.
# So for 4,255 blocks we make 4,255 calls and you get about two chances to run this script with the full blocks data.
